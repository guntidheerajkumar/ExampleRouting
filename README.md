ExampleRouting
==============

 ASP.NET routing enables you to use URLs that do not have to map to specific files in a Web site. Because the URL does not have to map to a file, you can use URLs that are descriptive of the user's action and therefore are more easily understood by users.

Routing is fundamentally about decomposing a URL endpoint into parameters and then using those parameters to steer the HTTP request processing to a specific component. Let's take the URL /recipe/5 as an example. With the proper routing configuration, you can still respond to this URL with the Web Form RecipeDisplay.aspx.
